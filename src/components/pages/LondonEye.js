                            The London Eye, also known as the Millennium Wheel, is an iconic landmark that has become synonymous with the city's skyline. It was conceived as part of London's millennium celebrations in 2000 and was originally intended to be a temporary structure. Designed by architects David Marks and Julia Barfield, the London Eye quickly captured the imagination of people worldwide with its innovative design and breathtaking views. Standing at a height of 135 meters (443 feet), it became the tallest Ferris wheel in Europe upon its opening. Due to its immense popularity and success as a tourist attraction, the London Eye was later made a permanent fixture on the Thames waterfront, offering visitors an unforgettable experience and panoramic views of London's landmarks.

                            Trevi Fountain, one of the most famous fountains in the world, has a rich history dating back to the 18th century. It was commissioned by Pope Clement XII in 1730 and designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi, with contributions from various sculptors including Pietro Bracci. The fountain is located at the junction of three roads ("tre vie" in Italian, hence the name "Trevi") and marks the terminal point of an ancient Roman aqueduct, the Aqua Virgo.

                            The fountain's design is a stunning example of Baroque artistry, featuring a grandiose facade adorned with statues and bas-reliefs that depict various mythological figures and scenes. The central figure is Oceanus, the god of the seas, riding a chariot pulled by seahorses and accompanied by tritons. The overall composition symbolizes the theme of water's life-giving force and the importance of the aqueduct in supplying water to Rome.

                            One of the most enduring traditions associated with Trevi Fountain is the custom of tossing a coin over one's shoulder into the water. Legend has it that if you toss a coin with your right hand over your left shoulder, you are guaranteed to return to Rome in the future. This tradition has made Trevi Fountain not only a stunning work of art but also a symbol of hope and wishes fulfilled for millions of visitors who flock to admire its beauty every year.

The central figure is Oceanus, the god of the sea, depicted in a majestic chariot drawn by two sea horses, symbolizing the power and vastness of the ocean. Flanking Oceanus are two Tritons, mythical sea creatures, one struggling with a sea monster and the other blowing a conch shell.
